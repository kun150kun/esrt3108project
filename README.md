# PLAN
  1.Modify DNN in Tensorflow (2 weeks) 
    arbitrary grapy (1 week)
    randomly generate DNNs (1 week)
  2.Implement loss functions (3 or more) (1 week)

  3.Implement GA & evolve sequence of loss functions (2 weeks)

  4.Evalution (1.5 weeks)
    baseline: single loss functions vs mix approach
    dataset: difficult image classification problem
  5.Report (1 week)
